# Silent Camera Preview Failure in Expo

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in Expo's Camera API. The issue involves a failure to display the camera preview without throwing any explicit error messages.  This occurs when attempting to access or manipulate the camera before it's fully initialized.

## Problem
The core problem lies in accessing camera properties or starting recording before the camera component has finished mounting and initializing. This usually happens within the component's `useEffect` hook, where asynchronous operations are performed.  The camera might not be ready, even if the mount is complete.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully managing the asynchronous initialization of the camera.  We ensure that all camera operations happen only after the camera is ready, using a state variable to track initialization status and a promise to handle the asynchronous nature of the camera API.
