The provided solution includes a state variable `isCameraReady` to indicate if the camera is initialized and ready to use. A promise ensures that all accesses to the camera are only done once it's ready.  The `useCamera` hook handles camera initialization and cleanup. The main component uses this hook to manage the camera and performs operations after confirming `isCameraReady`.  This prevents attempting to access the camera prematurely.
