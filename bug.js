This error occurs when using the Expo Camera API and attempting to access the camera's preview before it has fully initialized.  It's often seen when trying to manipulate the camera's properties or start recording too quickly after mounting the component. The error manifests as a silent failureâ€”no error message, but the camera preview doesn't appear or functions improperly.  It can be subtle and hard to debug as it's not a clear, thrown error.
